This is my first intern-driven initiative online internship , in which i made a market segmentation analysis project at a start-up company,named Feynn Labs,leaded by Mr. Sanjay Basumatary.
In this project, i had  analysed the Electric Vehicle market in India using Segmentation analysis and come up with a  feasible strategy to enter the market, targeting the segments most likely to use Electric vehicles.
i had worked on first variable of EV market ,i.e., vehicle type and done coding work on google colab using:
